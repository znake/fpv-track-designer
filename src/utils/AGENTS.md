## CONVENTIONS
- Pure functions by default: no store imports, no hidden UI side effects.
- Tests are co-located; add behavior-heavy edge cases near changed utilities.
- Constants stay near the top (`MIN_DISTANCE`, `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, clearance/sample values, payload prefixes).
- Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- Normalize gates/sequences before persistence, path calculation, or share-link serialization.
- Treat `gateTypeOptions.ts` ordering as canonical for UI lists and pole-count reporting.

## WHERE TO LOOK
| Task | File | Key Functions |
|------|------|---------------|
| Change generation algorithm | `generator.ts` | `generateTrack(config)` |
| Modify flight path | `flightPath.ts` | `calculateFlightPath(gates, sequence)` |
| Change gate movement | `gateOperations.ts` | `moveGate()`, `rotateGate()` |
| Modify gate openings | `gateOpenings.ts` | `createDefaultGateOpenings()`, `normalizeGates()` |
| Modify gate sequence | `gateSequence.ts` | `buildDefaultGateSequenceEntries()`, `normalizeGateSequence()` |
| Modify persistence | `storage.ts` | `saveTrack()`, `loadTrack()`, `listTracks()`, `deleteTrack()` |
| Modify share links | `shareTrack.ts` | `encodeTrackSharePayload()`, `decodeTrackSharePayload()`, `createTrackShareUrl()` |
| Change regen prompts | `generationConfig.ts` | generation-relevant config diff helpers |
| Change pole totals | `poleCount.ts`, `gateTypeOptions.ts` | pole count/grouping logic and display order |
| Change theme material colors | `themeColors.ts`, `src/types/theme.ts` | `getThemeConfig()`, `getGateColors()` |

## KEY CONSTRAINTS
- Min gate distance: 3m (`MIN_DISTANCE`).
- Max placement attempts: 100 per gate.
- Flight-path curve sampling is dense and gate-specific; preserve same-gate, dive, H-gate, double-H, and octagonal tunnel cases.
- Share payload prefix: `z.` for compressed payloads; keep legacy base64-url decode fallback.
- Storage key prefix: `fpv-track-`.
- Storage/import/share code must call schema helpers, not trust raw JSON.

## TESTING
- `flightPath.test.ts` is the path-geometry regression suite; preserve gate-specific cases.
- `generator.test.ts`, `gateOpenings.test.ts`, `gateSequence.test.ts`, and `storage.test.ts` cover core invariants.
- `shareTrack.test.ts`, `generationConfig.test.ts`, and `poleCount.test.ts` cover newer helpers.
- Browser API mocks, such as `localStorage`, `Blob`, URL, or hash payloads, stay local to each test file.
- No co-located tests currently cover `themeColors.ts` or `gateTypeOptions.ts`; add tests if behavior grows beyond lookup/order constants.
